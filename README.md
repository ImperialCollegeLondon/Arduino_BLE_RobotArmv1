# Arduino BLE RobotArm v1
Arduino program for controlling a Robot Arm via BLE

This is a small Arduino program designed to use the Intel Curie (ie the Genuino 101) to control a 6-degree of freedom Robot Arm via BLE.
It will work with any BLE programme. For example, I have created a web BLE example program to wirelessly control the robotic arm (Note:It ony works with Google Chrome):
